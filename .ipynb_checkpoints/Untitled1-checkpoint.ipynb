First, I applied converted the images to grayscale, second I applied a gaussian_blur with a kernel of size 5, third, I applied a canny filter, fourth, I applied a roi on the canny image image, fifth I applied the houghLinesP algorithm over on the canny image and sixth I merged all the lines into just two left and right lines.\n",
