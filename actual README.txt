In the P1.ipynb there is a code to process an image of the road, and to give as a result the same image but with some lines on, painted red to indicate the safe path. The original videos to be processed are in the folder "test_videos" 

The functions in P1.ipynb have their notes regarding their use.

The pipeline to generate the output is described in writeUP_Report files with extension ipynb, html or md.

The video results can be seen in the folder "test_videos_output".

The images of the pipeline are in the folder "test_images" each step has its prefix, for example: canny_solidWhiteCurve.jpg is the  result after applying the pipeline until this step, to the original image solidWhiteCurve.jpg
